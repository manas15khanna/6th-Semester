# Basic Terms of ASD 
1. **Agile**: A flexible and iterative approach to software development that focuses on collaboration, customer feedback and frequent releases. 
2. **Scrum**: 
	- A popular agile framework used to manage work 
	- It divides work into small cycles called as **Sprints**
3. **Sprints**: A time box periods (1-4 weeks) during which a set of tasks is completed and reviewed. 
4. **Product Backlog**: A list of all features, tasks and improvements needed in the product. It is maintained by the product owner 
5. **Sprint Backlog**: A subset of the product backlog chosen for a specific sprint 
6. **User Story**: A small simple description of a feature from the user's perspective 
7. **Product Owner:** The person who: 
	- Defines product requirements 
	- Prioritizes the backlog 
	- Represents customer needs 
8. **Scrum Master**: The person who facilitates the scrum process
	- removes the obstacles 
	- Help the team follow agile principle 
9. **Development Team**: A group of professionals who design, develop and deliver the product 
10. **Daily Scrum**: A short daily meeting (15 minutes) where team members answer: 
	1. What I did yesterday?
	2. What will I do today? 
	3. Any blockers or something
11. **Sprint Planning**: Meeting where the team decides: 
	1. what to work in the sprint
	2. How to do it
12. **Sprint Review**: A meeting at the end of the sprint to: 
	1. Demonstrate completed work 
	2. get feedback  
13. **Sprint Retrospective**: A meeting to discuss: 
	- what went well
	- what didn't 
	- how to improve
14. **Increment**: The working version of a product after a sprint 
15. **Burndown Chart**: A graph that shows: 
	1. Work remaining vs Time 
	2. Help track the sprint progress 
16. **Velocity**: Measures how much work a team completes in one sprint 
17. **DOD (Definition of Dull)**: A checklist that defines when a task if officially complete 
18. **MVP (Minimum Viable Product)**: A smallest version of a product with enough features to satisfy early users 
19. **Kanban Kaizen** 

# Agile Software Development Process 

# ASD 
- Flexibility 
- Collaboration 
- Customer Satisfaction 
- Welcoming Changes 
- Working Software
Agile Software Development leads to Low Product Failure Rate (PFR)
ASD is a software development methodology that values flexibility, collaboration and customer satisfaction 
# Difference between Agile and Waterfall Model 
| **Feature**          | **Agile**                 | **Waterfall**                     |
| -------------------- | ------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
|                      | Iterative and Incremental | Linear and Sequential Model       |
| Flexibility          | Highly Flexible           | Very rigid                        |
| Changes              | Easy and Welcome          | Difficult and Costly              |
| Customer  Involvment | Constant Interaction      | Only at the beginning and the end |
| Delivery             | Frequent Small Releases   | Final product at the end          |
| Documentation        | Lightweight Documentation | Heavy Documentation               |
| Risk                 | Low                       | High                              |
